8 Device Clusters and Attributes 

    The following Clusters are supported in SSLC release of the SS9007 Mini CT Meter: 
    - Basic 
    - On/Off 
    - Simple Metering 

    This section lists the available attributes in each supported cluster. 
    A maximum of 11 attributes can be configured for reporting at once. There is only one timer for attribute reports, and attributes will be reported at the interval specified in the most recent report configuration message. 
    Because ZigBee attributes have a variable size however, it may not be possible for a device to send 11 attributes in a single report.
    
    If the total size of the report exceeds the maximum payload size (60 bytes), some attributes will be excluded from the report. The device will not automatically follow up with the remaining attributes if this is the case, and any missing attributes must be requested separately.
